# Hey there! 👋 I'm Pabasara Karunarathna

I'm an AI/ML enthusiast and an undergrad at the University of Moratuwa, passionate about using tech to make life a bit easier (and a lot more fun). Whether it's creating mobile apps, diving into computer vision, or fine-tuning language models, I’m always ready to tackle new challenges. 🚀

I’ve worked on projects ranging from building lecture note generation apps with Langchain and RAG to experimenting with swarm intelligence in ant colonies. 🐜 Got a bit of experience with web development too—FastAPI and Flutter are my go-to tools. 

If you're into AI/ML, creative problem-solving, or just looking to collaborate on some cool projects, feel free to connect!
